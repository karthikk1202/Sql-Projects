## Projects  

### 1. IMDb Movie Analysis  
Analyzed IMDb movie dataset to extract insights about movies, directors, genres, and actors.  
- Cleaned and processed raw movie data (duplicates, nulls, formatting).  
- Identified movies with highest profit using gross and budget.  
- Generated IMDb Top 250 list filtered by rating and votes.  
- Ranked top directors by average ratings.  
- Found most popular genres and actors using aggregation.  
- Delivered results using Excel visualizations and summaries.  

### 2. Hiring Process Analytics  
Conducted analytics on a companyâ€™s hiring process to evaluate workforce diversity, salaries, and department distribution.  
- Cleaned and organized hiring dataset in Excel.  
- Gender-based hiring analysis (male vs female hires).  
- Calculated average salary of hired employees.  
- Created salary class intervals using pivot tables.  
- Analyzed workforce distribution by department and post tiers.  
- Visualized hiring statistics with charts (bar, pie).  
- Key insight: Operations and Service departments had the highest employee share.  

### 3. Operations Analytics & Investigating Metric Spikes  
Performed SQL-driven analysis on operational data to identify performance spikes and improvement areas.  
- Built and queried SQL Server databases for job reviews, events, and user data.  
- Case Study 1:  
  - Jobs reviewed per hour/day for November 2020.  
  - Throughput analysis using 7-day rolling averages.  
  - Language distribution analysis (Persian language dominant).  
  - Duplicate row detection using window functions.  
- Case Study 2:  
  - Weekly user engagement and growth analysis.  
  - Retention analysis using cohort method.  
  - Device-based weekly engagement insights.  
  - Email engagement metrics (34% open rate, 15% click rate).  
- Results: Identified usage trends, engagement drop-off points, and areas to optimize retention.  

### 4. Instagram User Analytics  
Analyzed Instagram user dataset to support marketing decisions and investor reporting.  
- Marketing insights:  
  - Identified 5 oldest users (loyalty analysis).  
  - Found inactive users with no posts.  
  - Declared contest winner (most likes on a post).  
  - Suggested top 5 most used hashtags.  
  - Determined best day for ad campaigns (based on registrations).  
- Investor metrics:  
  - Calculated average posts per user and overall engagement.  
  - Identified potential bots (users liking every photo).  
- Results: Derived insights for improving user experience, engagement strategies, and investor confidence.
